type error =
  [ `No_variable_rec
    (** Represents an error where a recursive variable is not allowed because that would lead to infinite recursion.
        E.g. [let rec x = x + 1] *)
  | `No_arg_rec
    (** Represents an error where the left-hand side of the recursive binding is not a var.
        E.g. [let rec [ a; b ] = ..] *)
  | `Bound_several_times of string
    (** Represents an error where a pattern bound the variable multiple times.
        E.g. [let x, x = ..] *)
  | `Occurs_check of string * ttype
    (** Represents an occurs check failure.
        This occurs when attempting to unify types, and one type is found to occur within another in a way that violates the rules of type systems.
        E.g. [let rec f x = f] *)
  | `No_variable of string
    (** Represents an error indicating that a variable could not be found in the current scope. *)
  | `Unification_failed of string * ttype * ttype
    (** Represents that type unification has failed.
        This occurs when two types cannot made equivalent during type inference. *)
